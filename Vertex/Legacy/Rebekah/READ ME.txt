In order to generate this report, you must export the data from Vertex and import the data into SQLite. Vertex is an Interbase database
dating back to 1998 and it doesn't support many of the functions and formatting in the SQL 96 spec. It is particularly slow when trying to 
join tables.

1. Query Vertex database using Queries_Vertex.sql, substitute the dates, with the dates requested in the email.
	a. You will get two result sets: Earnings, HealthWelfare
	b. Save both result sets to csv files (Earnings.csv, HealthWelfare)
2. Import *.csv files into SQLite database
	a. drop the two pre-existing tables tables in the db: Earnings, HealthWelfare (you may want to do a select * on each to get a feel for the layout and check the datatypes).
	b. Create two tables: Earnings, HealthWelfare.
	c. make sure you set the field data types or else you won't be able to apply the aggregate functions (sum, avg, etc).
	d. I like the SQLite Manager - Firefox plugin to import the data.
3. Query the sqlite database you just created, using the two queries in the Queries_sqlLite.sql
	a. Export the results from each query to an excel file, name them accordingly: Earnings.xls, HealthWelfare.xls.
4. Email to the person requesting the data (most likely Rebekah).
