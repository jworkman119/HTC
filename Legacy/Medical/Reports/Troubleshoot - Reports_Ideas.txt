Current Formulas:

Standard Units	UPD * WDPM
Productivity	Units/Standard Units
BHPD			Rick's Formula
UPD				BHPD * 4
AVG-UPD			Units/WDPM
WDPM			Total Hours/7.5	- Doctors
				Reported to me in Days in report from payroll - Staff
NSC-Rate		Cancellations/Scheduled Visits

1. BHPD - I would like to have that formula.
		  b. Here is the current Breakdown of BHPD per employee:
			
			Provider			BHPD
			Bushan, Bharat		6.50
			Butler, Thomas		5.09
			Fehlner, Kenton		5.20
			Gee, Stephanie		4.92
			Herbst, Kathy		2.70
			Hudyncia, Stephen	4.55
			Johnson, Nancy		5.34
			Karwacki, Ellen		2.60
			Lapolla, Cynthia	5.08
			Melnick, Benedetta	5.20
			Misiaszek, Walter	5.20
			Omidian, Bahram		5.20
			Patil, Vidaya		4.55
			Petty, Angela		5.09
			Phillips, Nancy		5.20
			Powell, Linnea		5.20
			Romano, Elaine		3.08
			Veilleux, Brenda	4.99
			Veiz, Suvada		5.09
			Voorhees, Francis	5.09
			Zelows, Linda		4.92
			
		It doesn't seem fair to grade people's productivity against one another, when you have different scales for each employee.
		
		I think it would be more fitting to have a 2 static numbers, 1 for staff and 1 for physicians.

2. WDPM - I don't think it's giving an accurate portryal of WDPM, given the current formula. I think the WDPM for physicians
	, should be:
			Total Hours/BHPD - it doesn't make sense to calculate, a workday = 7.5 hours, when we conclude, that a full day for a 
			physician is 5.2 (hours according to BHPD).

3. Following up to Rick's email/spreadsheet saying my numbers were off. If you look at the excel spreadsheet, Troubleshoot - Reports_02102011.xslx.
	I have  highlighted two specific trends:
		1. Red - fields in Rick's numbers that I don't report on.
		2. Blue - Cancellations.
		
	If you subtract cancellations from my overall numbers and the fields that I don't report on, we have the same numbers.
	If he wants to include more fields in the report then I have to be notified.
	
* I will prepare a report with revisions stated in #1 & #2 for Jan. 2011. We can do a comparision with "Month Productivity Survey Jan 2011".
Would be a good base for troubleshooting these issues.
