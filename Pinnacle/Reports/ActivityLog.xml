      <Notes>I met with Alex today at the Pinnacle Office. He continues to be out of work due to a recent auto/pedestrian accident on 8/1/2012.

Alex stated that his C-3 vertebrae is pinching a nerve in his neck and an orthopedic specialist stated that Alex might need to have surgery on his knee as a result of the accident. Alex Will be returning to work on 10/2/2012 with a lifting restriction of of 5lbs. Alex stated that he is ready to look for a job with more hours.

Alex has a BS degree in Finance and is interested in looking for something where he can better utilize his education. I asked my supervisor, Kristen Looman, to talk to Mary about agencies in the community that would benefit from Alex's education. Alex and I went online and looked at positions available at the Neighborhood Center, House of Good Shepard, and Catholic Charities.</Notes>
